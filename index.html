          <p>
            This project analyzes music streaming patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), examining how this 
            unprecedented global event influenced music consumption across six regions (United States, 
            United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, India, and Global charts). By combining Spotify streaming data with 
            audio features and historical Billboard charts, we explore:
            <br/>
            <ul>
            <li>How regional music preferences diverged or converged during the pandemic</li>
            <li>Whether listeners gravitated toward more positive or negative music during lockdowns</li>
            <li>Which genres gained or lost prominence during this period</li>
            <li>How audio characteristics (energy, danceability, mood) evolved month-by-month</li>
            <li>Comparison with pre-pandemic baseline trends from Billboard historical data</li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            The main dataset used for this project is the processed and 
            engineered CSV file final_dataset_engineered.csv, which contains 
            173,359 rows and 49 columns, covering tracks across regions and dates 
            during 2020–2021. The dataset includes original Spotify audio features 
            such as danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and acousticness, chart 
            metrics like rank, streams, and popularity, as well as engineered features
             including macro genre categories, trend scores, party and chill scores, 
             energy levels, mood classifications, and region categories. This comprehensive dataset 
             enables a detailed exploration of how music consumption and characteristics evolved over time. 
             Pre-aggregated visualization-ready datasets, such as monthly_genre_trends.csv and regional_audio_comparison.csv, 
             support the creation of D3.js and Altair visualizations.

            This graph was created using d3 to visualize the evolution of music genres over the course of 2020 and 2021.
            Each line represents a different genre, and the y-axis indicates the number of songs for that genre in a given month.
            From this visualization, we can observe trends such as Pop consistently ranking as the 
            most streamed genre. Furthermore, Pop music had a steady incline peaking around July of 2021
            and then declining towards the end of 2021. A couple genres - R&B/Soul, Jazz/Blues, Country, 
            Acoustic/Folk - had relatively low but stable streaming counts throughout the two years showing that these
            genres were not as popular.

            This graph was created using Altair to visualize the relationship between energy and mood (valence) of songs during 2020-2021.
            Each point represents a song, with its position determined by its energy (x-axis) and mood (y-axis) scores.
            From this visualization, we can observe that there is a positive correlation between energy and mood. 
            The visualization shows that genres like Pop and Electronic/Dance have the highest energy and mood. 
            In comparison, Acoustic/Folk has lower energy and mood. For the interaction,
            hovering over points shows the track name, artist, genre, energy, valence. Additionally,
            users can click on the different radio buttons to filter the songs by genre.

            This interactive bar chart was created using Altair to visualize the top streaming tracks across different
              global regions during 2020-2021. The chart uses a horizontal bar encoding, where each bar represents a
              song with the track name displayed on the y-axis and total stream count on the x-axis. The bars are
              sorted in descending order by streams, making it easy to identify the most popular tracks at a glance.
              From this visualization, we can observe significant regional variation in music preferences, for example,
              "Beggin'" dominated with over 120 million streams in Brazil, while more psychedelic R&B tracks like
              "Heat Waves" were more popular in the United States. The chart demonstrates how certain songs achieved massive
              global success while others resonated primarily with specific regional audiences. For the interaction,
              users can select different regions from the dropdown menu to filter and compare top hits across the
              United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, India, and Global charts, revealing how cultural
              preferences shaped streaming behavior during 2020.

         This radar chart was created using Plotly to compare audio characteristics of popular music across six
              regions: Brazil, Global, India, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States. The chart uses a polar
              coordinate system where each axis radiating from the center represents a different audio feature;
              energy, danceability, tempo, acousticness, and valence, with normalized values ranging from 0 to 1.
              Each region is represented by a colored polygon that connects its values across all five dimensions,
              with semi-transparent fills allowing for easy comparison of overlapping regions. From this visualization,
              we can observe both similarities and differences in regional preferences; notably, most regions cluster
              around similar danceability and energy levels, while India shows distinctly higher acousticness compared
              to other regions. Brazil and the United States demonstrate preferences for higher-energy, more danceable
              tracks. For the interaction, users can click the region buttons at the bottom to isolate individual
              regions or view all regions simultaneously, and hovering over the chart displays specific values for
              each audio feature.

          This stacked area chart was created using Plotly to track the evolution of music mood categories, Negative,
          Neutral, and Positive, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from January 2020 to late 2021. The chart uses
          a time-series encoding with months on the x-axis and track count on the y-axis, with three stacked areas
          representing each mood category distinguished by color (red for Negative, purple for Neutral, and green
          for Positive). Vertical dashed annotation lines mark key pandemic events: "Pandemic Declared" in March
          2020 and "Vaccine Rollout" in late 2020, providing important context for interpreting the trends. From
          this visualization, we can observe a compelling pattern: positive music (green) increased substantially
          after the vaccine rollout, growing from roughly equal proportions with neutral tracks to becoming the
          dominant mood category by mid-2021. This suggests listeners gravitated toward more uplifting music as
          pandemic conditions improved. For the interaction, users can hover over any point to see exact track
          counts for each mood category at that time, and use the toolbar to zoom, pan, or download the chart.

          <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Summary of Findings</h2>
          <p>
            Our analysis of music streaming patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) revealed several key 
            insights about how the COVID 19 pandemic shaped music consumption. First, we observed that Pop music consistently 
            dominated across all regions throughout the pandemic, with streaming counts peaking around July 2021 before
            declining toward the end of the year. Genres like R&B/Soul, Jazz/Blues, Country, and Acoustic/Folk maintained 
            stable but relatively low streaming numbers, showing niche but loyal listener bases.
            Examining the relationship between audio features, we found a positive correlation between energy and mood, with 
            high-energy genres like Pop and Electronic/Dance also showing higher mood scores, while Acoustic/Folk tended toward lower 
energy and lower emotional tones. This suggests listeners seeking upbeat music gravitated toward energetic tracks during the pandemic.
Regional analysis uncovered distinct cultural preferences in music consumption. Brazil and the United States 
demonstrated preferences for higher-energy, more danceable tracks, while regional hits varied significantly. Songs like "Beggin'" 
dominated in Brazil while "Heat Waves" was the most popualr in the United States.
In our mood trends analysis, it revealed a shift toward positive music following the vaccine rollout in late 2020.
 Prior to this milestone, negative, neutral, and positive tracks maintained relatively balanced proportions. However, after vaccines became available, 
 positive music grew to become the dominant mood category by mid-2021, this suggests that as the pandemic improved, 
 listeners seeked more positive music. This finding supports the broader understanding that music consumption reflects and responds to 
 emotional states during significant global events.
